Im not too familiar with linux and shell script so Ive been scouring the web for the last 2 days trying to figure out how to compile jave with shell script. 
The run.sh file I orovided runs the program perfactly on my mac bash terminal and basically consists of the bash/sh command to run it in the terminal. The terminal and the eclipse IDE are the only 2 things ive tested it on and it worked flawlessly on both. The code works when all the files are in the same directory ad the run.sh. 

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE LATEST JAVA JDK YOU WILL NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT FOR THE PRIGRAN TO RUN!! It can be found here http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html


1) download JDK
2) get files from GITHUB and place all FILES in the same FOLDER/DIRECTORY
3) you can then run it in the command line of the terminal by calling the run.sh from inside the same terminal as the files with the command " sh run.sh"
