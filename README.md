Im not too familiar with linux and shell script so Ive been scouring the web for the last 2 days trying to figure out how to compile jave with shell script. 
The run.sh file I orovided runs the program perfactly on my mac bash terminal and basically consists of the bash/sh command to run it in the terminal. The terminal and the eclipse IDE are the only 2 things ive tested it on and it worked flawlessly on both. The code works when all the files are in the same directory ad the run.sh.
